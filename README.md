# ArduinoCar

Improved on the classic obstacle avoidance problem by implementing a PID based code that enables the mini car to navigate through obstacles without having to stop.

PID stands for  proportional–integral–derivative controlle. Its is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control
